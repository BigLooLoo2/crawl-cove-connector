# Changelog

## 0.1.1 — 2026-09-22

- Fix: `resolve_url()` now verifies `get_post()` before returning a resolved
  id — WordPress core's `url_to_postid()` pattern-matches `?p=N` out of the
  query string and returns `N` even when no such post exists, so `/resolve`
  was reporting a phantom post as successfully resolved.
- Real-WordPress integration test harness (`tests/integration/`): SQLite
  drop-in, Rank Math and Yoast, all five REST routes end-to-end.
- Security pass: auth sweep, subscriber/author/editor capability matrix,
  `/apply` + `/resolve` payload fuzzing. No vulnerabilities found
  (`SECURITY-NOTES.md`).
- PHPCS clean against WordPress-Extra + WordPress-Docs (`phpcs.xml.dist`).
- POT file for translators (`languages/crawl-cove-connector.pot`).
- wordpress.org submission pack: icon/banner/screenshot assets
  (`wordpress-org/`).

## 0.1.0 — 2026-09-21

First version.

- Yoast SEO and Rank Math adapters (writes their native title/description post meta; empty string removes the override).
- REST API under `crawlcove/v1`: `/status`, `/resolve`, `/apply` (with `dry_run`), `/changes`, `/revert`.
- Authentication via WordPress core Application Passwords; `edit_posts` required on every route, `edit_post` re-checked per post.
- Change log (capped at 200 entries) with previous values; revert from the API or from Tools → Crawl Cove.
- Touched posts are re-saved after apply so Yoast's indexables pick the change up immediately (filter `ccc_touch_post_after_apply` to disable).
- Unit tests for the adapter, change log and service layers.
