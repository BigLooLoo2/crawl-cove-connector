# Changelog

## 0.1.0 — 2026-09-21

First version.

- Yoast SEO and Rank Math adapters (writes their native title/description post meta; empty string removes the override).
- REST API under `crawlcove/v1`: `/status`, `/resolve`, `/apply` (with `dry_run`), `/changes`, `/revert`.
- Authentication via WordPress core Application Passwords; `edit_posts` required on every route, `edit_post` re-checked per post.
- Change log (capped at 200 entries) with previous values; revert from the API or from Tools → Crawl Cove.
- Touched posts are re-saved after apply so Yoast's indexables pick the change up immediately (filter `ccc_touch_post_after_apply` to disable).
- Unit tests for the adapter, change log and service layers.
